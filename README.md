Financial Planning. Getting started with Indian stock selection.



Hi folks.
This is my first project building a model which does your financial planning.





I am aware that financial planning is more complex and needs more information then I have asked in my model. You should consult your financial advisor before coming to any conculsion.



My idea here is to just get started, as fresher are ability to take more risk is high i.e (Less responsibility, More money at your disposal etc etc)
You can start your investment journey.





**Step 1**
This model tries to understand your risk appetite. By asking some basic questions. Then categorizing you in an investment category.

**Step 2**
This model calculates how much amount would be require to reach your goal within a stipulated time.

**Step 3** (Primary dataset taken for ticker_tape) 
Let's you choose the sector from Nifty 500

**Step 4** (Using Yahoo Finance)
From yohoo finance api, you can check your selected sector stock historial performance via historic average, standard deviation, coefficient of variation.


Open for changes.
Thanks
